I'm Paritosh, a NASA HOME Postdoctoral Fellow at Georgia Tech's School of Industrial and Systems Engineering. I'm working on using a Vertical Federated Learning aspects to make any future habitats on Mars smarter and more resilient to failures!  

I got my PhD. in Computational Science and Engineering at the [School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech](https://ww.isye.gatech.edu). 
I was co-advised by [Prof. Nagi Gebraeel](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/people/faculty/Nagi_Gebraeel/) from Industrial Engineering and [Prof. Edmond Chow](https://www.edmondchow.com) from Computational Science.
At Georgia Tech my research comprised of asynchronous solutions to large-scale decentralized optimization problems with applications to power systems, machine learning and linear solvers.
I also explored the use of blockchain as a decentralization tool. Turns out, it has some interesting features that can be leveraged to reduce costs and improve privacy as compared to cloud based alternatives for IIoT analytics!

My prior life!
======

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I got my Masters degree with a [thesis](https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cs_theses/81/) in Computer Science from Georgia State University in Spring 2015.
At Georgia State, I worked with [Prof. Wenzhan Song](http://sensorweb.engr.uga.edu/index.php/song/) on developing INDIGO, a distributed gossip framework for seismic tomography.
We also did some interesting stuff applying concepts of seismic ray tracing to wireless mesh network for anomaly detection.

We also deployed our sensors on the Llaima volcano in southern Chile.
The Geo Sciences department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill covered our field deployment. You can read it [here](http://endeavors.unc.edu/llaima_volcano_expedition).


My prior prior life!
======

Before I started at Georgia State, I went to BITS-Pilani, Goa where I did my Bachelors in Information Systems. As an undergrad, I did some research in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) under [Dr. Sreejith V](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/srev/profile).
